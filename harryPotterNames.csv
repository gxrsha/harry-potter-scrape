They then made up a number of ridiculous educational decrees, the final one being that she was made headmistress of Hogwarts after Dumbledore left. As a teacher, she did not let students use magic in her class (because she thought that they would raid against the ministry). She also gave out rather cruel detentions, making students write on paper with their own blood, which she bewitched the pen to cut the students hand open and the blood came from that. She forced Harry to take him to the weapon that she thought Dumbledore was trying to use against the ministry.
